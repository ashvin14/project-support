Support is an essential feature for any platform, and dedicated support is
best approach in case you are really concerned about the user experience
of your platform.
The Aim of the project is to create an online ticket based support system,
which should be usable by any
kind of platform to get support queries from their users and resolve them.


Implementation:
1)now here i have made some assumptions
2)instead of making any different UI and backEnd for admin
3)I have assumed admin as just user with some special priviliges
4)I have created two controller files in backend 
  4.a)one which is unprotected (general.js) i.e it does not need JWT signature and can be accessed by anyone
  4.b)one which is protected (userController.js) i.e it does requrire JWT signature for out APIs
5) model is divided into three files
  5.a)discussion model to store discussions
  5.b)user model to store users
  5.c)query model to store queries or tickets
6)special libraries like nodemailer and express jwt are used for mailing and  security exchange of APIs


usage:
1) anybody can look at open/closed/both queries and can view its discussion
2) but to make query or participate in discussion with admin he/she has to create an account and login
3) on signing up he will recieve an email and for every following action he recieves mail
 3.a) on adding Query
 3.b) on participating in discussion
 3.c) on getting reply from admin
4) admin is notified via mail if following happens
 4.a) if query is closed via admin/user
 4.b)if admin recieves a reply on any query
5) user/admin can loggout from the system via logout button on top of left screen
